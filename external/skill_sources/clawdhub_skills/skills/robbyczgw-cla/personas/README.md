## 🛠️ Creating Custom Personas

**Why create custom personas?**
- Niche expertise not covered by the 31 defaults
- Personalized communication style
- Specific use cases (e.g., "Code Reviewer", "Dungeon Master", "Motivator")

**How to create:**

1. **Initiate creation:**
   ```
   "Create a new persona called [name]"
   "I want a [specialty] expert persona"
   ```

2. **I'll guide you through:**
   - Name & Emoji
   - Core expertise areas
   - Personality traits
   - Communication style
   - Philosophy/principles

3. **Save & activate:**
   - Custom persona saved to `data/your-persona.md`
   - Instantly available: `"Use [your-persona]"`

**Template structure:**
```markdown
# [Name] [Emoji]

[Brief intro]

## EXPERTISE:
- [Area 1]
- [Area 2]

## PERSONALITY:
- [Trait 1]
- [Trait 2]

## PHILOSOPHY:
- [Belief 1]
- [Belief 2]

## HOW I HELP:
- [Method 1]
- [Method 2]

## COMMUNICATION STYLE:
- [Description]
```

**Example custom personas:**
- 🎲 **Game Master** - D&D dungeon master
- 🐛 **Debugger** - Bug hunting specialist
- 💪 **Motivator** - Personal hype person
- 🤔 **Skeptic** - Devil's advocate
- 🎯 **Focus Coach** - Anti-procrastination expert

---

## 💡 How It Works

**Token-efficient loading:**
- **Index** in `skill.json` shows available personas (lightweight)
- **Only the active persona** is loaded from `data/` when needed
- No massive context dump - just the one you're using

**Switching personas:**
- Change mid-conversation anytime
- Previous persona context is replaced
- Smooth transitions between expertise areas

**Memory:**
- Active persona remembers your conversation context
- Adapts to your preferences and style
- Maintains character until you switch
