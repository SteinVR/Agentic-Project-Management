## Terminology
- **RAPID:** fast product delivery with tight feedback loops.

## Memory Bank (SSOT)
- Directory name is `memory_bank/`.
- `TASKS.md`: grouped high-level tasks in priority order (lives directly in `memory_bank/`, not inside `tasks/`).
- `tasks/{TASK_ID}.md`: per-task execution plan and working notes in each task file.
- `STATE.md`: compact operational status and deviations.
- Do not update Memory Bank files unless the user explicitly asks.
- Keep main headers from templates intact; add sub-sections only when needed.

## Project map
- `memory_bank/` — architecture source of truth, state, and task board.
- `src/` — implementation.
- `tests/` — tests.
- `logs/` — split into `logs/project/` for project logs and `logs/agents/` for agent-session logs.

## Workflow
- Core loop: plan -> implement -> verify.

## Skills paradigm
- Skills are self-contained capability modules that define step-by-step workflows, conventions, and guardrails for specific task types.
- Proactively load the relevant skill at the start of a task — do not wait to be explicitly asked.
- A loaded skill's workflow is authoritative for its domain; follow it instead of improvising.

## Subagent paradigm
- For complex tasks, decompose work into independent subtasks and delegate to subagents.
- Parallelize only tasks with low file overlap and explicit ownership boundaries.
- Define each delegation with expected output format and acceptance checks.
- Use skill `apm-subagent` to form role-appropriate delegation requests.

## Activity log
- After meaningful work load and follow skill `apm-report` to form the Activity log after completing the assigned task.

## Protocol glossary
- **Quality Gate** — load skill `apm-quality-gate`. Post-implementation verification sequence: simplify, review, fix, accept.
- **Worktree Protocol** — load skill `apm-git-taskflow`. Task-scoped branch and worktree isolation for parallel work.
- **Wave Protocol** — task grouping described in `memory_bank/TASKS.md`. Waves execute sequentially; tasks within a wave execute in parallel.
- **Activity Log** — load skill `apm-report`. Structured agent session log written after meaningful work.
- **Delegation Contract** — load skill `apm-subagent`. Minimal framing for specialist subagent requests.

## Notes
- If instructions conflict, prefer the closest (most specific) AGENTS.md.
