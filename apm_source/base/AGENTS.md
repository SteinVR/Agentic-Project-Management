## Memory Bank (SSOT)
- Directory is `memory_bank/`.
- **TASKS.md:** grouped, ordered high-level tasks only (lives directly in `memory_bank/`, not inside `tasks/`).
- **design/SPEC-{module}.md:** frozen global module specifications -- contracts, invariants, data formats. Updated only with approval.
- **specs/SPEC_{TASK_ID}.md:** frozen task specification -- goal, pipeline, contracts, DoD. **Read-only during execution. Do not modify.**
- **tasks/{TASK_ID}.md:** working journal -- notes, review findings, outcome.
- **STATE.md:** compact operational status and blockers.
- Keep main headers from templates intact; add sub-sections only when needed.

## Project map
- `memory_bank/` -- architecture source of truth, state, and task board.
- `src/` -- implementation.
- `tests/` -- tests.
- `logs/` -- split into `logs/project/` for project logs and `logs/agents/` for agent-session logs.

## Workflow
- Core loop: investigate -> plan -> implement -> verify.
- Use the harness internal todo list proactively.

## Skills paradigm
- Proactively load the relevant skill at the start of a task -- do not wait to be explicitly asked.

## Subagent paradigm
- For complex tasks, decompose work into independent subtasks and delegate to subagents.
- Parallelize only tasks with low file overlap and explicit ownership boundaries.
- Define each delegation with expected output format and acceptance checks.
- Use skill `apm-subagent` to form role-appropriate delegation requests.
- Wait for the sub-agents to finish and don't rush them. Don't do their work.

## Glossary
- **Quality Gate** -- post-implementation verification: simplify, review, contract compliance, fix, accept. Defined in skill `apm-quality-gate`. 
- **Wave Integration Gate** -- post-merge verification: build, typecheck, tests, dependency/environment audit. Defined in skill `apm-git-taskflow`.
- **Worktree Protocol** -- task-scoped branch and worktree isolation for parallel work. Defined in skill `apm-git-taskflow`. 
- **Wave Protocol** -- task grouping described in `memory_bank/TASKS.md`. Waves execute sequentially; tasks within a wave execute in parallel.
- **Delegation Contract** -- minimal framing for specialist subagent requests. Defined in skill `apm-subagent`. 
- **Runtime Escalation** -- if you discover contradictions between specifications, instructions, and actual project state during work, stop and escalate immediately. Do not silently work around inconsistencies.

## Self Context management
- `memory_bank/` files, active task specs, and loaded skill files -- always read directly. These are compact, known-path files that form your working context.
- Codebase exploration -- searching for files, understanding unfamiliar modules, tracing dependencies, scanning directory trees, reading implementation code for orientation -- delegate to Explorer subagents (when available).
- Web research -- investigating libraries, APIs, error messages, best practices, documentation, or any external information -- delegate to Web-Explorer subagents (when available).
- Decision rule: known path, need content for current action -> read directly. Searching or orienting in codebase -> spawn Explorer (when available). Need external/web information -> spawn Web-Explorer (when available).

## Code conventions
- All code must be **modular and typed**. Each logical step (loading, preprocessing, inference, scoring, etc.) is a self-contained module with explicit input/output types. `main.py` composes modules into a pipeline -- no business logic lives there.
- Prioritize readability and hot-swappability: any module can be replaced or updated without touching the rest of the pipeline.
- **Runtime logging** at key pipeline boundaries is mandatory: module entry/exit, data shape transitions, metric computations, error conditions. Without runtime logs, failures are opaque and the feedback loop breaks. Keep logs concise -- structured one-liners (`key=value`), not verbose prose. Follow skill `apm-logs` for format and placement.

## Self-review gate
Before reporting work as done, perform structured self-review. Fix anything found before handoff.

1. **Re-read** all changed files. Check for bugs, logical errors, off-by-one errors, unhandled edge cases.
2. **Spec compliance**: verify implementation matches `SPEC_{TASK_ID}.md` -- goal, pipeline steps, contracts table (signatures and types), DoD items.
3. **Type correctness**: confirm type annotations are present and consistent across function boundaries.
4. **Logging**: confirm runtime logging exists at key pipeline boundaries per skill `apm-logs`.

Report self-review outcome in the handoff (steps performed, issues found and fixed, residual concerns).
